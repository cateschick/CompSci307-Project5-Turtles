# Display

This folder contains abstractions of the Display class. 

As a user navigates through the application, this class ensures that all
necessary displays are accounted for and do not reset when a user navigates
to a different display.

Currently, this application has the following displays:

1. Drawing Display: Where the user sees a Turtle and Pen draw selected files
2. Intro Display: Where the user sees a welcome message and the option to select a parser
3. Open File Display: Where a user navigates through existing files to select one to open
4. Settings Display: Where a user can change design settings
5. Language Display: Where a user can dynamically change the language of the application
